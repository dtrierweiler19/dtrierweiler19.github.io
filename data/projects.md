<li>Website design, User Research, and Content Strategy-University of Washington 2014 Capstone Project:  "Creating for Community: Designing a Website for the Refugee Forum of King County:" 

For this approx 6-month project, myself and two fellow UW MLIS students embarked on an intensive project to flex our User Experienc/UX skills by working collaborative in the rapid and iterative production style inspired by agile development methodologies. For this project, we worked closely with our nonprofit sponsors to design, develop and conduct user research to produce and launch our final WordPress website product (using a customized theme), the RFKC's first-ever website. 

As the primary Content Strategist for the RFKC site, I took the lead on critical communications, editorial, and content-based initiatives such as:
<ul>
<li>Ensuring User Access to Instruction Materials and Process Transparency</li>
<li>Establishing and Fielding a Help-Desk System to Field Site-Relevant Issues</li>
<li>Gathering, Organizing, and Editing User Content tp Meet Stylistic and Functional Site Requirements</li>
</ul>
