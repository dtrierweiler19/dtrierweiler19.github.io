<h4>Creating for Community: Designing a Website for the Refugee Forum of King County</h4>

<p>Over the course of roughly 6-months, two fellow UW MLIS students and I worked collaboratively to produce a custom website for our sponsors, the Refugee Forum of King County (RFKC)who needed to share information across numerous non-profit organization but aside from monthly in-person meetings, had only been communicating through social media.</p>

<p>The Seattle nonprofit had been interested in building its first website for several years due to the frequently changing refugee population needs, but had yet been unsuccessful. Our team worked closely with RFKC leadership to conduct user research, design, and create our final product: a custom WordPress website that would make the complex nature of local refugee services more accessible to the communities and organizations that serve them </p>

<p>Our project methods required that we frequently worked as a team, although we took on specialized roles as well. As primary Content Strategist for the RFKC site, I served as the champion for communication, editorial, and content-based initiatives such as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Front-end requirements gathering</li>
    <li>Stakeholder wrangling </li>
    <li>Project hand-off deliverables: recruited and trained in-house volunteer web coordinators to ensure website maintenance at project close</li>
    <li>User feedback and communication via surveys, help-desk fielding, and usability testing</li>
    <li>Content coordination</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pacific Northwest "Puget Sounds" Digital Audio Archives</h4>

<p>Intern and Graduate Student Assistant at the UW Libraries Media Center: I had the opportunity to investigate digital preservation techniques and collection development. The Puget Sounds project captures the spirit of alternative music and performance in music venues unique to Seattle.</p>

<p>By digitizing, re-encoding, and editing audio files using Audacity, an open source sound editing tool, as well as creating academic LibGuides, I was able to create a unique and context-rigch cultural online resource for the UW Library community and wider public. Some collections have been uploaded to cloud-based audio service Soundcloud.com to maximize direct user access to content if only temporarily, until similarly usable and longer-term access repository options may be identified</p>
