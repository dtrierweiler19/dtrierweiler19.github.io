<h4>"Creating for Community: Designing a Website for the Refugee Forum of King County"</h4>

<p>Over the course of roughly 6-months, two fellow UW MLIS students and I worked collaboratively to produce a website for our sponsors, the Refugee Forum of King County (RFKC). This Seattle nonprofit had been interested in building its first website for several years, but had yet been unsuccessful. Our team worked closely with RFKC to conduct user research, design, develop our final product: a fully functional, WordPress website using a custom theme.</p>

<p>Our design and development goals for the site were ambitious. We worked in a rapid and iterative production style inspired by agile and lean development methodologies. We centered our scope around core values of accessability, usability, and scalability in order to succeed in creating a functional, attractive, and sustainable website.</p>

<p>Our project methods required that we frequently worked as a team,  although we took on specialized roles as well. As primary Content Strategist for the RFKC site, I served as the champion for communication, editorial, and content-based initiatives such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gathering, organizing, and editing user written content to meet stylistic and functional site requirements</li>
<li>Engaging user interest and increasing project "buy-in" by ensuring users remain informed on project progress </li>
<li>Recruiting and training volunteer web coordinators to ensure website maintenance at project close</li>
<li>Soliciting user feedback though surveys, help-desk fielding, and usability testing</li>
<li>Content coordination</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pacific Northwest "Puget Sounds" Digital Audio Archives</h4>
<p>Intern and Graduate Student Assistant at the UW Libraries Media Center: I have had several opportunities to investigate digital preservation techniques and collection development. Two projects in particular captured the spirit of alternative music and performance in music venues unique to Seattle.</p>
<p>By digitizing, re-encoding, and editing audio files using Audacity, an open source sound editing tool, as well as creating academic LibGuides, I was able to create a unique and context-rigch cultural online resource for the UW Library community and wider public. Both collections have been uploaded to cloud-based audio service Soundcloud.com to maximize direct user access to content if only temporarily, until similarly usable and longer-term access repository options may be identified</p>
