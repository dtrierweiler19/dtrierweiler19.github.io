<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>I am currently seeking opportunities in a community rich, user-centered information service environment where I might explore my interests in research design, project and collection management, content management and strategy, and the socio-cultural and technical impacts of user experience/UX in digital web technologies.

<ul>
<li>Effective communication skills with an English major's sense of both verbal and written form and function</li>
<li>Curiousity and a creative problem-solver</li>
<li>Commitment to information service and adding value: 4+ years of public, academic, and special library experience</li>
<li>Motivation for user-centered design in library infomation service, technology, and web design</li>
<li>Versatility in instruction: experienced with instructor support, graduate student assesment and individualized student feedback conducted both in-person and via a learning management system (Canvas LMS), I employ a blend of traditional as well as experiential and social learning tactics </li>
<li>Experience with and willingness to learn basic operational administrative tasks: budgeting, grant-writing, and non-profit organizational funding process and procedures</li>
