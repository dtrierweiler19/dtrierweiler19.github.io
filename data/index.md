<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p class="lead">Do you have a messy, complicated information challenge in need of relevance, accessibility, and order? I may be able to help! As a graduate of the ALA-accredited Masters in Library and Information Science (MLIS) degree program at the the University of Washington Information School. I currently live in the Seattle, WA and while onsite projects are preferred, I also collaborate remotely.</p>

<p>What do I love about information? To be breif yet exhaustive, everything. I particularly seek opportunities in community rich, user-centered information service environments where I can explore my interests including digital collection management, content management and strategy, and user experience/UX. My strengths?</p>

<ul>
<li>Effective communication skills with an English major's sense of both verbal and written form and function</li>
<li>Curiousity and a creative problem-solver</li>
<li>Commitment to information service and adding value: 5+ years of public, academic, and special library experience</li>
<li>Motivation for user-centered design in library infomation service, technology, and web design</li>
<li>Versatile, digitally-centered information literacy instruction: experienced with instructor support (course or single-session), graduate and undergraduate student assesment and individualized student feedback conducted both in-person and via a learning management system (Canvas or Moodle LMS). I employ a blend of traditional as well as experiential and social learning tactics </li>
<li>Experience with and willingness to learn basic operational administrative tasks: budgeting, grant-writing, and non-profit organizational funding process and procedures</li>
<li>Compassion and cross-cultural competence: I respect and advocate for diversity in people and their information needs</li>
</ul>
